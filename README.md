I have created a basic sudoko solver in C++! To use this, simply create a .txt file. In this .txt file, have each of sudoko grid values paired with their row and column value. For example, a sample input could be 0 0 3. This would mean on row 0, column 0, there is a value of 3. 

Have the input file have at least 17 of these values for the grid to be solved. Enjoy!
