I have created a basic sudoko solver in C++! This sudoku solver will be able to solve any easy, medium, or difficult sudokus. 


To use the solver, simply create a .txt file. In this .txt file, have each of sudoko grid values paired with their row and column value. 

For example, a sample input could be 0 0 3. This would mean on row 0, column 0, there is a value of 3.

Then, in the .txt file, seperate each value by one line (look at sample input file and output file). Since sudoku's need at least 17 values to be able to be solved, you will need 17 or more values in the .txt file. 

That's it! Enjoy!
