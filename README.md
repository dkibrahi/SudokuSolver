I have created a basic sudoko solver in C++! This sudoku solver will be able to solve any easy, meduim, or difficult sudokus. 


To use the solver, simply create a .txt file. In this .txt file, have each of sudoko grid values paired with their row and column value. 

For example, a sample input could be 0 0 3. This would mean on row 0, column 0, there is a value of 3.

In the .txt file, seperate each value by one line. 



Have the input file have at least 17 of these values for the grid to be solved. Enjoy!
